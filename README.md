# **Detecting Evil with Splunk and MITRE ATT&CK**

## **Introduction**  
Cybersecurity isnâ€™t just about running queriesâ€”itâ€™s about understanding **how attackers think and operate**. Attackers follow patterns, and frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK** and **Splunk** allow us to track these patterns and detect their movements.

In this write-up, Iâ€™ll walk you through how I used Splunk, MITRE ATT&CK, and **Atomic Red Team tests** to detect adversary techniques in action. Iâ€™ll include **actual event data captured in Splunk**, highlight the sections of MITRE ATT&CK that informed my detection methods, and showcase how defenders can create meaningful rules to flag **malicious activity** while avoiding noise.

Hereâ€™s what weâ€™ll cover:  
- Mapping **BITS Job (T1197)** and **PowerShell Execution (T1059.001)** to real-world attack scenarios.  
- Using **Splunk queries** to spot attackers.  
- Applying **MITRE ATT&CK detection guidance** to differentiate **evil from false positives**.  
- Crafting **basic detection rules** that improve SOC workflows.  

---

## **Technique 1: BITS Job (T1197)**  

### **Simulating the Attack**  
The attacker leverages the legitimate tool `bitsadmin.exe` to transfer files while bypassing detection. Once the file is transferred, they set up a **scheduled task** to execute a payload laterâ€”establishing persistence.  

**Test Details:**  
```plaintext
Invoke-AtomicTest T1197 -ShowDetailsBrief  
Invoke-AtomicTest T1197  
```

---

### **Captured Events in Splunk**  
Below is the query I ran to detect `bitsadmin.exe` usage:  
```plaintext
index=project bits  
| search (CommandLine="*bitsadmin*" OR CommandLine="*CreateTask*")  
| table _time, ParentImage, ParentCommandLine, Image, CommandLine  
| sort +_time  
```

Hereâ€™s an example Splunk event captured during the test:  

| **_time**         | **ParentImage** | **ParentCommandLine**                    | **Image**     | **CommandLine**                              |  
|--------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------|  
| 2025-04-07 13:00  | cmd.exe         | C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe              | bitsadmin.exe | bitsadmin.exe /create AttackBits /addfile    |  

---

### **Using MITRE ATT&CK Detection Guidance**  
To detect this, I referenced **MITRE ATT&CKâ€™s T1197 Detection Section**. Hereâ€™s what I looked for:  
- **Unusual Parent Processes:** `bitsadmin.exe` spawned by `cmd.exe` instead of a typical system utility.  
- **Suspicious Flags in Commands:** `/addfile` pointing to external domains.  
- **Scheduled Tasks:** Commands involving `/setnotifycmdline` that trigger persistence.

---

### **Differentiating False Positives from Evil**  
Hereâ€™s the breakdown:  
- **False Positive:** `bitsadmin.exe` transferring legitimate files during Windows updates. Example: `/create update_task`.  
- **Evil:** `bitsadmin.exe` downloading a payload from `maliciousdomain.com` with a task scheduled for execution.  

Key highlight: **Not all BITS jobs are threats**. Focus on external domains, odd execution chains, or unusually timed commands.

---

## **Technique 2: PowerShell Execution (T1059.001)**  

### **Simulating the Attack**  
Attackers use PowerShell for script execution, reconnaissance, and privilege escalation. In this simulation, I ran a command to check user privileges using `whoami.exe`.  

**Test Details:**  
```plaintext
Invoke-AtomicTest T1059 -ShowDetailsBrief  
Invoke-AtomicTest T1059  
```

---

### **Captured Events in Splunk**  
Below is the query I ran to detect PowerShell activity:  
```plaintext
index=project powershell  
| search (ParentImage="*\\powershell.exe" OR Image="*\\powershell.exe")  
| table _time, ParentImage, ParentCommandLine, Image, CommandLine  
| sort +_time  
```

Hereâ€™s an example Splunk event captured during the test:  

| **_time**         | **ParentImage**       | **ParentCommandLine**                   | **Image**        | **CommandLine**                 |  
|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|  
| 2025-04-07 13:10  | powershell.exe        | C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\  | powershell.exe   | powershell.exe whoami.exe       |  

---

### **Using MITRE ATT&CK Detection Guidance**  
To detect this, I referenced **MITRE ATT&CKâ€™s T1059.001 Detection Section**. Hereâ€™s what I looked for:  
- **Unusual Binaries Executed:** PowerShell running `whoami.exe`, which isnâ€™t typical admin usage.  
- **Obfuscated Commands:** Parameters like `-EncodedCommand`.  
- **Parent-Child Relationships:** PowerShell launched by non-admin applications (e.g., Office macros).

---

### **Differentiating False Positives from Evil**  
Hereâ€™s the breakdown:  
- **False Positive:** PowerShell executed by IT administrators running maintenance scripts. Example: `Get-ADUser`.  
- **Evil:** PowerShell runs obfuscated payloads (`-EncodedCommand`) or commands like `whoami.exe` for privilege enumeration.  

Key highlight: Not all PowerShell usage is malicious. **Focus on encoded commands, suspicious binaries, or odd invocation chains.**

---

## **Building Basic Detection Rules**  

### **PowerShell Detection Rule**  
Hereâ€™s a rule that flags PowerShell executing reconnaissance commands:  
```plaintext
index=project powershell  
| search (Image="*\\powershell.exe")  
| eval alert_type=if(match(CommandLine, "whoami"), "Potential Recon", "Unknown")  
| where alert_type="Potential Recon"  
| stats count by _time, alert_type, CommandLine  
```

## **What Else Can You Do?**  
Youâ€™ve captured key events, mapped them to MITRE ATT&CK, and built detection rulesâ€”but whatâ€™s next?  

ðŸ”¹ Expand framework application:  
- Test additional MITRE ATT&CK techniques like **Registry Modifications** or **Lateral Movement**.  
- Correlate techniques to build **attack sequences** in Splunk.

ðŸ”¹ Add more educational value:  
- Document **step-by-step guides** for SOC analysts to detect these techniques.  
- Highlight MITRE ATT&CK sections with relevant detection recommendations.  

---

## **Final Thoughts**  
This project demonstrates how **small attack simulations reveal big lessons**. By tying Splunk events to frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and the Cyber Kill Chain, you can develop detection strategies that track attacker actions while filtering out benign noise.  

Cybersecurity isnâ€™t just about finding threatsâ€”itâ€™s about knowing **whatâ€™s worth chasing** and **how to chase smarter**.
